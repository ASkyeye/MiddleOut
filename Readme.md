# MiddleOut

## This tool was created to compress files through the command line and should work with execute-assembly.

To use, add in the files to compress (any amount) and the final flag is the zip file name. For some examples:

`MiddleOut.exe test.txt this.txt file.exe zipArchive.zip`

`MiddleOut.exe * zipArchive.zip`

`MiddleOut.exe someDirectory\test.txt someOtherDirectory\* zipArchive.zip`
